## Introduction to TypeScript

Increasingly, developers are relying upon JavaScript to build rich, dynamic web applications. It's not uncommon for 50% (or more) of the application's code to be written in JavaScript. As the use of JavaScript has increased and the applications have become larger and larger, so to have the challenges of developing and maintaining these applications.

TypeScript, introduced by Microsoft in October 2012, is a strict superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and ECMAScript 6 language features such as classes, modules, and arrow functions. TypeScript's static typing allows tooling to provide richer support for features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. All of this together helps ease the development of large JavaScript applications.

This presentation will cover:

* Overview of TypeScript Basic Concepts
* General Information About TypeScript
* Converting an Existing Web Application to TypeScript
