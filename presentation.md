# What is TypeScript?

* Superset of JavaScript
* Optional type system
* Features from the future (ES6, ES7)

---

# Dynamic Typing

* Variable type is interpreted at runtime
* Developer can provide less information
* Bugs are often discovered at runtime

---

# Static Typing

* Variable types are known at compile time
* Compiler can perform type checking
* Allows bugs to be caught early

---

# Tooling

* TypeScript Playground
* Atom - [https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* Sublime Text
* WebStorm
* Visual Studio
* And others (like Emacs and Vi)

---

# Rich Tooling Support

* Static checking
* Symbol-based navigation
* Statement completion
* Code refactoring

---

# Why Do We Care?

* TypeScript is just a tool... use it, or don't
* Increased productivity = happier developers
* Higher quality solutions = happier users

---

# Language Overview

^ Demo: Show how to use the compiler from the command line
^ Demo: Show basic language concepts from Atom

# Project Tracker App

In order to keep the focus on TypeScript, the following choices were made:

* No SPA framework
* No build process
* No unit tests
* No form validation
